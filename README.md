# SIC-XE Assembler
Luke Cotton

## What is it?
This assembler is for a theoretical computer architecture called the SIC-XE architecture. This architecture is a simplified computer architecture for learning systems programming. This program takes an assembly program for SIC-XE, and assembles it into an object program.

## How to compile.
You can compile the assembler with:
```
make
```
and it should compile just fine.

## How to run.
Just run it by calling ./assembler like so:
```
./assembler <input file> <output file>
```
Where input file is the input file you want to assemble, and the output file is where you want the object program to be stored.
